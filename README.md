# range

Range is a random data generator.

# Usage

## Generation configuration

Range works based on a JSON configuration file. An example is as follows:

```
{

	config: {
	
		// The number of data items to be generated
		limit:	5,
		
		// The output format of the generated data
		format:	"csv",
		
		// The location to persist the generated data
		location: "/tmp/output.csv",
		
		// The data properties:
		//		- the name of the property
		//		- the type of the property
		// 		- refer to com.narmnevis.range.generator for the supported types
		data: {
			date:				"date",
			description:		"enum(gift, income, loan, budget, temp)",
			amount:				"range(0, 1000)",
			email:				"regex([a-z]{4}\\@[a-z]{4}\\.com)",
			from:				"enum(P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10)",
			to:					"enum(P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10)"
		}
	}

}
```

in which:

* `limit` is the number of data items to be generated.
* `format` is the for format with which the generated is published.
* `location` is the location at which the generated data is published.
* `data` holds the "names" and "types" of the data items to be generated.
 
## Generate data

To generate data:

* Download the distribution package from [here][v1] and unpack it.
* Create your generation configuration as described above.
* Run the following script:

```bash
/path/to/range-1.0-standanle/range.sh /path/to/range/config
```
* Collect the generated data from `location` configured in the configuration file.


# Development

## Install

To install range locally:

1. Checkout the code
2. Either use Maven or Gradle:

```
mvn clean install
```
or 
```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

## Range API

### Maven Dependency

To have range in your project, first build it locally as described above, then include the following dependency in your project:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.narmnevis.range</groupId>
	<artifactId>range</artifactId>
	<version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

in which `VERSION` is either a SNAPSHOT or a released version.

### Starting example

Using Range API is as simple as follows: 

```java
    String configPath = "retrieve path to the configuration file";
    Range range = new Range().withConfiguration(configPath);
    Data data = range.generate();
```

### Extend Range

#### Custom Data Generators

A generator in Range implements `Generator` interface:

```java
public class UUIDGenerator implements Generator {

	public Object generate(RangeContext context) {
		return UUID.randomUUID().toString();
	}

}
```

To use a custom generator in Range config:

1. Define the data property as:
```myField:	"class:org.mypackage.UUIDGenerator"```
2. Make sure that the custom generator class is included in the classpath.

To use a custom generator in Range API:

```java 
Range range = new Range()
		.withSize(10)
		.withLocation("/tmp/data.csv").withOutputFormat("CSV")
		.withDataSpec("id", "range(1,100)").withDataSpec("uuid", "class:org.package.UUIDGenerator");
Data data = range.generate();
```
